Goal of the Game
--
The goal of the game is to either eliminate the opponent's pieces or control both the black and white tiles (at the top and bottom of the board, respectively).

How to play
--
  - You control the white pieces, and as such, you have first move
  - Select one of your pieces to see where it can move
    - click on the piece again to cancel the selection
    - the piece can move to the green tiles without attacking an opposing piece
    - the piece can attack units on tiles that are red
    - [click here] [wiki] for a more in-depth look at how each piece may move

Wait.. Waht?
